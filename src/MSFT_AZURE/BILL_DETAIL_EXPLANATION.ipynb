    "### Explanation of Relevant Features for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost and EffectiveCost, EffectivePrice, UnitPrice, Quantity, PaygPrice**: \n",
    "   - Useful for understanding overall expenses and how they translate across different billing periods.\n",
    "   - Analysis can help identify trends in spending, assess budget adherence, and inform cost-saving strategies.\n",
    "   - Inisight about service plan and discounts (and when to use then) payasugo ->associated to effective price and unit price\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BillingPeriodStartDate, and BillingPeriodEndDate**:\n",
    "   - These fields enable time-based analysis of costs, allowing for the identification of patterns and anomalies over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Date, Qty**:\n",
    "      - TODO : verify that ab[\"Date\"][i] + Quantity.days[i] < ab[\"Date\"][i+1]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ChargeType**: \n",
    "   - Analysis can differentiate between usage, purchases, and refunds to better understand expense types and their implications on budget management.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ConsumedService**: \n",
    "   - Helps in identifying which services are generating costs, enabling targeted optimizations and service evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CostCenter**: \n",
    "   - Allows for departmental analysis of costs, assisting organizations in tracking expenses related to specific teams or projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Tags**: \n",
    "   - Tags facilitate internal chargebacks and help in grouping costs by project or department, supporting detailed financial analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **EffectivePrice and UnitPrice, PayGPrice**: \n",
    "   - Important for analyzing the actual cost against budgeted amounts, providing insights into pricing strategies and potential savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **MeterCategory and MeterRegion**:\n",
    "   - Useful for regional analysis of usage and cost distribution, which can inform strategic decisions on resource\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Additionnal Info [Consumed Quantity] [VCPUs]**:  \n",
    "   - Useful to assess the power consumption per hour and find correlations between the cost and the number of CPUs used.\n",
    "   - Can be useful to map where the VM with the most CPUs are located in the world (link with MeterRegion)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **MeterRegion, ResourceRegion(greenit) and Location**:(the only meterId that has no missing values with Location are Virtual Machines\n",
    "      - Useful to map where services are from and where they are deployed\n",
    "      - Can display interesting insight on the prefered locations of the energy-demanding resources (WEU, NA etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **InvoiceSection and InvoiceName**:\n",
    "      - Identifiers on where the resource is being used in your ogranization according to the Enterprise Agreement (EA)\n",
    "      - Can be used to map how the resources are used in the organizations that use certain type of billing plan."
